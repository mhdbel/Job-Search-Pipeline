A Python-based pipeline to automate scraping job listings from job boards, company websites, and recruitment sources. The pipeline identifies recent and interesting job offers with fewer applicants, and notifies users via email or publishes the results as a PDF to a cloud destination.

---

## **Features**
- **Scraping**: Extracts job data from multiple job boards and company websites.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and deduplicates scraped data.
- **Analysis**: Identifies recent and interesting job offers based on predefined criteria (e.g., fewer applicants).
- **Notification**: Sends results via email or generates a PDF report stored in the cloud.
- **Logging**: Logs pipeline activities and errors for debugging and monitoring.
